You find yourself in a beautuful meadow.
Lounging at the foot of a large oak tree.
You are reading your history lesson with your good friend Alice. 

Suddenly, a white rabbit dashes by.
He is wearing a waistcoat and looking at a pocket watch.

You hear him say, I'm late, I'm late!!!

You follow the white rabbit to a hole at the bottom of the tree.
You peer into the hole and fall down, down inside the tree.
Objects whizz past you, chairs, tables, clocks.
You land in a strange room with 3 doors.
